C Program to Print Pyramids and Patterns
In this example, you will learn to print half pyramids, inverted pyramids, full pyramids, inverted full pyramids, Pascal's triangle, and Floyd's triangle in C Programming.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following C programming topics:

C if...else Statement
C for Loop
C while and do...while Loop
C break and continue
Here is a list of programs you will find in this page.

# Program to display the Fibonacci sequence up to n-th term

nterms = int(input("How many terms? "))

# first two terms
n1, n2 = 0, 1
count = 0

# check if the number of terms is valid
if nterms <= 0:
   print("Please enter a positive integer")
# if there is only one term, return n1
elif nterms == 1:
   print("Fibonacci sequence upto",nterms,":")
   print(n1)
# generate fibonacci sequence
else:
   print("Fibonacci sequence:")
   while count < nterms:
       print(n1)
       nth = n1 + n2
       # update values
       n1 = n2
       n2 = nth
       count += 1
